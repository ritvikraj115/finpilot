## üöÄ Key Features

* **Expense Tracking**
  Log your transactions (debits/credits) by category and date. View daily, weekly, and monthly summaries.

* **Budget Management**
  Define monthly spending limits per category (Food, Education, Apparel, Transportation, Household, Miscellaneous). See at-a-glance how much you‚Äôve spent vs. your limits.

* **Interactive Dashboards & Charts**

  * **Bar Chart**: Compare actual spend vs. set limit for each category.
  * **Line Chart**: Visualize your next seven predicted transaction amounts.
  * **Histogram**: Distribution of upcoming expense counts.
  * **Doughnut (optional)**: Overall budget utilization percentage.

* **Alerts & Risk Indicators**
  Automatically detect the category with the highest ‚Äúspent-to-limit‚Äù ratio and flag it as **At-Risk** if you‚Äôre close to (or over) budget.

* **Transaction Analytics**

  * Count and average your daily transactions over the past 30 days.
  * Drill down on spikes, weekends vs. weekdays, and day-of-week patterns.

* **REST API Backend**

  * **/insights/getinsights**: Fetch 3‚Äì4 personalized, ‚Äúlife-saving‚Äù budgeting insights.
  * **/forecast**: Return the next 7 transaction forecasts (and a 30-day transaction average).
  * **/retrain**: Retrain the LSTM model on new data.

## ü§ñ AI & ML Features

### 1. **AI Budgeting Advisor**

* Powered by Google Gemini via `@google/genai`.
* Provides **3‚Äì4 actionable**, personalized insights (in JSON) based on your:

  * Historical budgets & spend
  * Last 3 months of actual spending
  * Your upcoming budget plan

### 2. **Time-Series Forecasting**

* A sequence-to-sequence LSTM predicts your **next 7** transaction amounts:

  1. Log-transform and scale your last 30 days of daily totals.
  2. Feed into an LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras) and forecast 7 future points.
  3. Invert the transformations to get real-world amounts.
* Automatically retrainable via the `/retrain` endpoint.

### 3. **Transaction Rate Analytics**

* Aggregates the count of transactions per day for the past 30 days.
* Computes **average transactions per day** to help you understand your spending frequency.

## üîÑ Retraining & Model Updates

* Send a POST to `/retrain` with JSON:

  ```json
  { "series": [/* 30‚Äì365 daily values */] }
  ```
* The pipeline will re-scale, re-sequence, retrain the LSTM, and save a new model + scaler.
